        "body": "Congressional committee members warned on Friday that Washingtonâ€™s funding of the World Health Organizationâ€™s cancer research agency could be halted unless it is more open about its operations. In a letter to the France-based International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) - a semi-autonomous unit of the WHO - the U.S. House of Representatives Science, Space, and Technology (SST) Committee warned it â€œmay reconsider U.S. taxpayer fundingâ€ if IARC â€œdoes not demonstrate transparencyâ€. No-one at IARC, which is based in Lyon, France, was immediately available to comment. Since 1985, IARC has received more than $48 million from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, $22 million of which has gone to IARCâ€™s â€œmonographâ€ program, which assesses whether various substances can cause cancer in people. Fridayâ€™s letter is the latest twist in an ongoing feud between IARC and two congressional committees.",

While all three deductions are maintained in some form in one or both of the rival Senate and House of Representatives bills, far fewer taxpayers could take advantage of them because of other proposed changes",

Her statement suggested Republicans would have to find the votes they need to pass the bill among their own members. If a short-term funding measure is not approved by the Republican-led Congress and signed by Republican President Donald Trump, all but the most essential parts of the federal government will shut down.",
